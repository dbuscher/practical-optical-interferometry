# Practical Optical Interferometry

## Background
This repository contains supplementary material for the book "Practical Optical Interferometry". See the [supplementary material main page](https://dbuscher.github.io/practical-optical-interferometry/) and the [figures page](http://dbuscher.github.io/practical-optical-interferometry/figures/) for more details.

## Requirements
The Python files have all been converted to work with Python3. Use with Python2 is not supported, but should not be too hard as the original code ran under Python2.7. Detailed module requirements are in the requirements.txt file, but recent versions of `numpy`, `astropy` and `matplotlib` are the minimum required for the majority of the plots.

## Installation
Download (for example using the "download as ZIP file" link on the right hand side of the page) and unpack a copy of this repository. To recreate the PDF files of the plots go to the plots subdirectory and type "make". To recreate the PDF files of the diagrams go to the diagrams subdirectory and type "make". This latter requires the inkscape and epstopdf executables.

## Licence
The python code is realeased under a BSD licence and the SVG diagrams are released under a Creative Commons licence. See the README files in the respective directories for more detail.
