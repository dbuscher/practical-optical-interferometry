Practical optical interferometry
================================

Imaging at visible and infrared wavelengths
-------------------------------------------

This website provides supplementary material for the book ["Practical Optical Interferometry"](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/astronomy/observational-astronomy-techniques-and-instrumentation/practical-optical-interferometry-imaging-visible-and-infrared-wavelengths), published by Cambridge University Press. A preview of the book is available on [Google Books](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3XgZCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR8&ots=99oJnFmTh3&lr=lang_en&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false).

The supplementary material consists of
 * Links to other online material: websites with further information about interferometry, data reduction and image reconstruction software etc.
 * Source material for the diagrams: Python code for the graphs in the book and editable versions of the diagrams.
 * An interferometry simulation framework: an extensible Python framework for simulating the data from a ground-based optical interferometer
 * Errata
